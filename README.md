This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

You can preview your app locally before deploying to Vercel! Here’s how:

---

### 1. **Start the Local Development Server**

In your project directory, run:

```sh
npm run dev
```
or, if you use yarn:
```sh
yarn dev
```

---

### 2. **Open in Your Browser**

- After running the command, you’ll see output like:
  ```
  Local: http://localhost:3000
  ```
- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

---

### 3. **Test All Flows**

- Sign up as a customer, restaurant, delivery agent, and admin.
- Try the full order, delivery, and admin flows.
- Check for any errors or missing features.

---

### 4. **If You See Errors**

- Make sure your `.env.local` file is set up with your Supabase credentials.
- Check the terminal for error messages.
- Let me know if you need help debugging!

---

**Once you’re happy with the local preview, you can deploy to Vercel for a live, shareable version!**

Would you like help with any specific part of the local preview or want a checklist for testing?
